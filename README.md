# A Handcrafted Meeting Web Client

A hand-crafted meeting web client, built entirely using HTML, CSS, and a selection of external SDKs and APIs. This project aims to offer a streamlined and user-friendly platform where people can meet and interact online. Whether you're hosting a quick team catch-up, a virtual event, or just connecting with friends, this provides a simple yet effective solution for real-time communication.

## How This Idea Clicked Me?

The inspiration behind this project stemmed from the need for a straightforward, no-fuss meeting platform. In a world where virtual communication has become the norm, I wanted to create a web client that was both functional and easy to use. By leveraging powerful external SDKs and APIs, I was able to build a platform that not only facilitates meetings but also enhances the overall user experience with minimal setup and maximum efficiency. Every line of code is crafted with care, reflecting my dedication to creating meaningful and accessible web experiences.
